# Card Battle Game with DSL-Based Card Creation

## DESCRIPTION

This project is a strategy card game developed in Unity, where players accumulate power through rounds to achieve victory. The game features a unique mini-compiler that allows players to create and customize their cards using a domain-specific language (DSL).

## FEATURES

### DYNAMIC CARD CREATION:
Utilize a custom DSL to define and generate cards, offering players flexibility and creativity in how they build their decks.

### TURN-BASED STRATEGY:
Players alternate turns, playing cards from their hands to their side of the field. Victory is achieved by accumulating more power than the opponent in a best-of-three rounds format.

### PLAYER MANAGEMENT:
Each player has a hand, field, and graveyard, with the ability to interact with their cards through various effects.

### ROUND-BASED GAMEPLAY:
The first player to win two rounds claims victory. The game automatically resets and tracks progress across rounds.

### SCALABLE AND EXTENSIBLE:
The game architecture is designed to be easily extended with new card types, effects, and game mechanics.
